# dgm-lexicon

DevenirGameMaster is a french tabletop rpg content creator.
With his community he has multiple inside jokes, memes and references that are unknown by people outside of the community.
This situation leads to him having to explain these jokes to people he meets which can get a bit annoying.

dgm-lexicon is a website created so that people can look up these jokes and references and understand them without having to ask.

# Add entries
If you want to contribute to the project, the easiest way is to send me a message on [discord](https://discord.com/channels/1207648183178760262/1391567892734021702) with
- the title of the entry
- the description of the entry (markdown is supported)
- the date when the entry first appeared
- the tags associated with the entry

If you prefer to do it yourself, you can get the file `db.csv` under [`db.csv`](https://rignchen.github.io/dgm-lexicon/db.csv) or in the repository under [`publics/db-prod.csv`](https://github.com/Rignchen/dgm-lexicon/blob/main/public/db-prod.csv).\
Once you have the file, the easiest way to edit it is to use a spreadsheet software like [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/) or [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel).\
In the spreadsheet, add a new row at the bottom of it with the following columns:

| id | word | definition | first_time_used | tags |
|----|------|------------|-----------------|------|
| take the last id + 1 | the title of the entry | the description of the entry (markdown is supported) | the date when the entry first appeared (format: YYYY-MM-DD) | the tags associated with the entry (comma separated), you can find the list of tags at the top of the spreadsheet |

Once your modifications done, save it back to csv and send it to me so I can update the website.

If you are confortable with git and github, you can also open a pull request with your changes instead of sending me the file.

## Microsoft Excel
While most spreadsheet software (including libreoffice calc) have no problem with csv files in UTF-8 (=all characters), it is not the case for Microsoft Excel.\
To open the file in Excel, you need to follow [these steps](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/opening-csv-utf-8-files-correctly-in-excel-8a935af5-3416-4edd-ba7e-3dfd2bc4a032):
1. Open Excel
2. Create a new blank spreadsheet
3. Go to the `Data` tab
4. Click on `Get Data` > `From File` > `From Text/CSV`
5. Select the `db.csv` file
6. In the preview window, verify that the `File Origin` is set to `65001: Unicode (UTF-8)` and the `Delimiter` is set to `Comma`
7. Click on `Load`

Once your modifications are done, do not export it back to csv as Excel will replace all accented characters with `ï¿½`, instead save it as an Excel file and send it to me, I can convert it back to csv using LibreOffice Calc.
